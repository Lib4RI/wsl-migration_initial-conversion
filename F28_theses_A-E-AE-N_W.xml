    REMARKS REGARDING <FILTEREXPRESSION>-tag:
    - strings that exist as field-names in FileMaker will be
      replaced by their values
    - those values, if not set (i.e., having a value of None), will be
      replaced by ''
    - if the final expression eval()-uates to True, the publication will be
      included
    - otherwise the publication will be discarded
    - there is an optional attribute "EXCLUDEPERSONMATCHES" that can have
      as value a comma-separated list from the set
      {'AuthorsOnly', 'EditorsOnly', 'AuthorsAndEditors',
       'NeitherAuthorsNorEditors'}:
      Publications that have matches in the (co-)authors,
      resp. editor lists alone, or both or neither,
      are then excluded from the list to export.
    EXAMPLES:
    - <FILTEREXPRESSION>True</FILTEREXPRESSION>
    - <FILTEREXPRESSION EXCLUDEPERSONMATCHES="EditorsOnly, AuthorsAndEditors, NeitherAuthorsNorEditors">'Jl.Revie' == 'x' and 'Repository Export' != 'nein'</FILTEREXPRESSION>
  -->
  <FILTEREXPRESSION>'Dissertation' == 'x' and 'Repository Export' != 'nein'</FILTEREXPRESSION>
